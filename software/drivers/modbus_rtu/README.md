# Modbus RTU slave driver — USART1 on PD6, DE/RE on PC2

Implements the TDS §2 driver layer: framing/CRC, t3.5 gap detection,
address filtering, FC03/04/06/16, standard exceptions, no-clamp range
rejection, atomic FC16, quantity validation, big-endian data /
little-endian CRC, FC06 echo & FC16 confirm responses, and app-owned
register semantics (holding table with min/max, input-read callback,
cross-validate hook for FR-S31 and FR-E06).

> **Provenance.** This driver is carried over unchanged from the sibling
> [`windmeters-modbus-interface`](https://github.com/pe1mew/windmeters-modbus-interface)
> project, phase 3. The verification below was performed **there**, on the
> same MCU and the same framework, but not on this project's hardware —
> there is no hardware here yet. Fix bugs in both places.

## HIL verification (source project, 2026-07-03, TTL rig, no transceiver)

`mb_check.py`, M2K as bit-banged open-drain master on the shared PD6 wire,
Saleae raw-edge decode:

- **26/26 matrix vectors** covering FR-MB02/05/06/08–15/19/22/25/28/30 and
  the cross-register constraint via the hook
- **40/40 endurance transactions**, zero loss
- **Response latency: median 5.2 ms, worst 5.2 ms** (FR-MB21 typical <15 ms,
  FR-MB20 hard <100 ms)

Later, through a MAX3485: 1000/1000 requests at 4.07/4.12/4.17/4.44 ms
(min/med/p99/max), plus split-frame, garbage-flood and off-baud vectors.

## Two hard-won design decisions (bench-forced, both product-relevant)

**1. No HDSEL — remap-switching line discipline.** In HDSEL single-wire
mode this part intermittently (~35%) swallowed the FIRST byte after bus
idle with no error flags (wire verified pristine at 10 MS/s; the stashed
frame was the request minus its address byte). Instead the driver uses the
SOP-8 remap geometry: the DEFAULT USART map has **RX natively on PD6**;
`mb_send()` temporarily switches to partial remap 2 (TX→PD6), transmits,
and switches back. Modbus is strictly request/response, so the direction is
always known. Side benefit: no self-echo during reception (FR-MB23
satisfied by flag-clearing around the TX window).

**2. Polled RX — zero interrupts.** With the RXNE ISR, ~1/3 of frames
reached the parser with missing/scrambled leading bytes while the USART
never flagged an error — symptoms of ISR prologue/state corruption on this
toolchain path (`__attribute__((interrupt))` on RV32EC, unconfirmed root
cause; treat ANY interrupt use in this project as suspect until
investigated). Polling from the main loop (~1 µs cycle vs 1042 µs per
byte) is provably lossless and removed every failure instantly:
26/26 + 40/40 vs the ISR build's chaos.

**Neither is a candidate for cleanup.** Both look like workarounds and both
cost real bench days to find.

## Diagnostics (exposed as shell input registers)

`mb_crc_error_count` / `mb_served_count` (published as 30009/30010 by this
project's register image), plus bench registers: FE/NE/ORE counters and a
last-CRC-fail frame stash (len, first bytes, received CRC) — the stash is
what cracked the first-byte-loss hunt.

## API (`lib/mb/`)

```c
mb_config_t cfg = {.address, .holdings, .n_holdings,
                   .input_read, .cross_validate};
void mb_init(const mb_config_t *cfg);
void mb_poll(void);   // main loop; self-timed via SysTick->CNT
```

The test shell in `src/main.c` is the source project's phase-3 harness; it
exercises the driver against a small stand-in register table. Retarget it
to this project's map (TDS §2.7/§2.8) before running `mb_check.py` on a
board here.
