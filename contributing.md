# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Please follow the guidelines below to ensure a smooth contribution process.

## Getting Started
1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button on the repository's page.
2. **Clone Your Fork** (with submodules — the KiCad libraries are submodules):
   ```sh
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/pe1mew/wire-encoder-modbus-interface.git
   ```
3. **Create a Branch**: Use a descriptive branch name for your changes:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Making Changes
- **Requirements first**: firmware behavior is specified in
  [`design/TDS.md`](design/TDS.md) with numbered requirements (FR-MB…,
  FR-S…, FR-E…, NFR-…). Behavior changes start with a TDS change; code and
  tests reference the requirement IDs they implement. Start from the design
  index [`design/README.md`](design/README.md).
- **Firmware changes**: the release build must build — `pio run` from
  `software/firmware/` (resource ceilings are enforced by the build). If you
  touch anything the optional end-switch feature reaches, build
  `-e encoder_endswitch` too.
- **Hardware-verified changes**: if you have the bench (WCH-LinkE, Saleae
  Logic 2, ADALM2000 — see [`software/hil/README.md`](software/hil/README.md)),
  run the acceptance suite against the flashed device:
  `pytest software/hil/acceptance`.
  Never release the `encoder_test` binary (it contains bench-only hooks).
- Keep commits focused and meaningful; write clear commit messages.
- **Update documentation** — the design documents in `design/` are part of
  the deliverable, not an afterthought. Public headers carry Doxygen; keep
  it current and regenerate the site (`doxygen Doxyfile`) when APIs change.
- **Carried-over code**: `software/drivers/modbus_rtu/`,
  `software/drivers/common/` and the `board`/`persist` firmware modules come
  from the sibling
  [`windmeters-modbus-interface`](https://github.com/pe1mew/windmeters-modbus-interface)
  repository, where they are HIL-verified on silicon. Fix bugs in both
  places, and say so in the commit message — a silent divergence costs the
  next person the bench time that proved them.

## Submitting a Pull Request
1. **Push to Your Fork**:
   ```sh
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Open a Pull Request**:
   - Navigate to the original repository.
   - Click on "New Pull Request".
   - Select your branch and provide a clear description of your changes.

## Code Review Process
- PRs will be reviewed by maintainers.
- Be open to feedback and make necessary changes.
- Ensure your branch is up to date with the latest main branch before merging.

## Reporting Issues
- Check if the issue has already been reported.
- Provide detailed information, including steps to reproduce the issue.
- Use clear and concise language.

## Community Standards
